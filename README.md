- ✅ Real-time player chat
- ✅ Persistent save system (Firestore)
- ✅ All 13 sound effects and atmospheric music
- ✅ AI-powered NPC conversations
- ✅ Mobile-friendly interface (no keyboard required)
- ✅ Instant access - no installation needed

### Optional: Local Development Setup

> **Note:** The local CLI versions are for development purposes. The full game experience (multiplayer, NPCs, save system, sounds) requires the Firebase-hosted version.

#### Option 1: Interactive CLI

**No typing! Just arrow keys and Enter**

```bash
python3 main_interactive.py
```

Features:
- Navigate with ↑/↓ arrow keys
- Select actions with Enter
- Visual menus showing all available actions
- Local single-player only

#### Option 2: Classic CLI

**Traditional text-based commands**

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Type commands like `go north`, `take key`, `use candle`, etc.

#### Option 3: Local Web Server

**For development/testing only**

```bash
cd web
python3 app.py
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:5001`

**Note:** Local web server has limited functionality compared to Firebase deployment.

## 🤖 AI NPCs (Optional Feature)

### Meet the Ghosts

The game includes two AI-powered NPCs that guard essential items:

- **👧 Little Eliza** (Entrance Hall) - Guards the Candle, loves riddles
- **📚 Edgar Blackwood** (Library) - Guards the Ancient Amulet, speaks in riddles

### Setup AI NPCs

1. Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip3 install google-generativeai
   ```
3. Run with your API key:
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here' ./start_with_ai.sh
   ```
4. Open: `http://localhost:5008`

### How AI NPCs Work

1. Talk to NPCs by clicking "💬 Talk to [Name]"
2. They'll give you a unique puzzle/riddle (powered by AI!)
3. Answer by clicking "💭 Answer Puzzle" and typing your response
4. If correct, they'll give you the item they're guarding!

**Note:** The game works perfectly without AI NPCs - they're an optional enhancement!

### Class Design

**Location** - Manages a game location
- Properties: name, description, state dictionary, items, exits
- Methods: describe(), get_state(), set_state(), add_item(), remove_item()

**Item** - Represents a mobile item
- Properties: name, description, use_targets
- Can be picked up and carried in inventory

**StationaryObject** - Interactive environment object
- Properties: name, description, interaction messages
- Triggers state changes when interacted with

**Player** - Manages player state
- Properties: current_location, inventory, max_inventory
- Methods: add_item(), remove_item(), has_item(), move_to()

**GameEngine** - Central controller
- Loads game data from JSON files
- Manages game state and persistence
- Processes commands and coordinates interactions

**MultiplayerGameEngine** - Multiplayer controller (Web)
- Thread-safe state management
- Real-time synchronization via WebSockets
- Shared world state with individual player sessions

### Persistence

**CLI Version:**
- File: `saves/game_state.json`
- Scope: Single player
- Contains: Player location, inventory, all location states

**Web/Multiplayer Version:**
- File: `web/saves/multiplayer_game_state.json`
- Scope: Shared world state
- Contains: Location states, item positions
- Note: Player inventory is session-based

**Why JSON?**
- Human-readable for debugging
- Native Python support (no external dependencies)
- Simple structure suitable for requirements
- Thread-safe with proper locking

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Interactive CLI not working?
- Make sure you're in a real terminal (not remote session)
- Install inquirer: `pip3 install inquirer`

### "Command not found" in classic CLI?
- Type `help` to see all available commands
- Commands are case-insensitive

### Port already in use (web)?
- Kill existing process: `pkill -f "python3 app.py"`
- Or edit port number in `web/app.py`

### AI NPCs not responding?
- Check your API key is set: `echo $GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Make sure you installed: `pip3 install google-generativeai`
- Check API key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
