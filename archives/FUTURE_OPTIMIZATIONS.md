- Implement real-time button enable/disable
- Better visual feedback for invalid actions

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

### 3. Enhanced Interactive CLI âœ… (Works but limited)

**Status:** Functional in native terminals only

**Current Limitation:**
- Requires real TTY (doesn't work in remote/SSH sessions)
- Dependencies on terminal capabilities

**Future Improvements:**
- Fallback mode for non-interactive terminals
- Better cross-platform compatibility
- Support for Windows terminals
- Enhanced visual themes

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

- PvP modes (racing to escape)
- Chat system
- Player matchmaking

**Requirements:**
- Enhanced state synchronization
- Real-time event system
- Anti-cheat mechanisms
- Lobby/room browser

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

#### More Content

**Game Expansions:**
- Additional locations (Attic, Dining Room, Garden, Crypt)
- More complex puzzles
- Multiple escape routes
- Difficulty levels
- Randomized item locations
- Procedurally generated mansion layouts

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks per major content pack

#### Mobile-Responsive Web UI

**Enhancements:**
- Touch-optimized controls
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- Offline mode
- Mobile-specific layout
- Swipe gestures for navigation

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

#### Sound & Visual Enhancements

**Features:**
- Background ambient sounds
- Sound effects for actions
- ASCII art for locations
- Animated text effects
- Theme customization (light/dark modes)
- Accessibility improvements (screen reader support)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

#### Analytics & Monitoring

**Features:**
- Player behavior analytics
- Common failure points tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Error logging and alerts
- Usage statistics

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Event-Driven System

**Current:** Direct method calls between components
**Future:** Event bus architecture

**Benefits:**
- Looser coupling
- Easier to add new features
- Better testing
- Plugin system support

### 2. Database Migration

**Current:** JSON file storage
**Future:** SQLite/PostgreSQL

**Benefits:**
- Better query performance
- ACID compliance
- Concurrent access handling
- Scalability

### 3. API Layer

**Current:** Direct game engine access
**Future:** RESTful/GraphQL API

**Benefits:**
- Multiple client support
- Better security
- Rate limiting
- API versioning

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

**Current:** Manual testing
**Future:** Automated test suite

**Components:**
- Unit tests for all models
- Integration tests for game flow
- End-to-end tests for multiplayer
- Performance benchmarks
- Load testing for concurrent players

## Deployment Considerations

### Hosting Options

**Current:** Local development server
**Future Options:**
- Heroku (easy deployment)
- AWS EC2 (full control)
- DigitalOcean Droplets (cost-effective)
- Docker containers (portability)
- Kubernetes (scalability)

## Contributing

If continuing development on this project, prioritize:

1. **Stability first** - Fix existing features before adding new ones
2. **User testing** - Get feedback on current gameplay
3. **Documentation** - Keep docs updated with code changes
4. **Incremental** - Small, tested changes over large rewrites

## Questions to Address

- What's the target audience? (Casual players vs. hardcore adventure gamers)
- Single-player focus or multiplayer emphasis?
- Monetization strategy? (Free, paid, freemium, ads)
- Platform priorities? (Web, mobile, desktop)
- Content vs. features balance?
