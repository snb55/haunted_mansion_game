# ✅ AI IS NOW WORKING!

## The Problem

**Error**: `404 models/gemini-pro is not found`

The code was using an outdated model name `gemini-pro` which doesn't exist anymore.

## The Fix

Updated to use **Gemini 2.0 Flash** - the latest, fast model!

```python
# Before (broken):
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

# After (working!):
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash')
```
