## Known Behaviors (Not Bugs)

### 1. Idempotent Joins
**Behavior:** Same player can join a room multiple times
**Reason:** Intentional design for reconnection scenarios
**Status:** ‚úÖ Working as intended

### 2. Execute Without Explicit Join
**Behavior:** Players can execute commands without calling join_room first
**Reason:** Auto-join mechanism for seamless gameplay
**Status:** ‚úÖ Working as intended

### 3. Shared Game State
**Behavior:** All players in a room share same location/inventory
**Reason:** Cooperative multiplayer design
**Status:** ‚úÖ Working as intended

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- ‚úÖ Room code validation (6 chars, alphanumeric uppercase)
- ‚úÖ User ID verification via headers
- ‚úÖ Firebase security rules (assumed)
- ‚úÖ Chat message sanitization (escapeHtml)

### Recommendations
1. Add rate limiting for room creation (prevent spam)
2. Implement room expiry (auto-delete inactive rooms)
3. Add max players per room limit
4. Consider room passwords for private games
5. Add profanity filter for chat messages
