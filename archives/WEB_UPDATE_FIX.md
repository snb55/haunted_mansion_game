# ðŸ”§ Web Interface Fix - Location Description Update

## Issue Fixed

The middle section (location description) was not updating after executing commands. You could see the action result, but the "where you are now" description stayed the same.

## What Was Changed

### Backend (`web/simple_app.py`)
- Added `location_desc` to the `/api/execute` response
- Now after every command, the server sends the updated location description

### Frontend (`web/templates/simple.html`)
- Modified `executeCommand()` to update the location description
- Now the middle section updates to show your current location after every action

## How It Works Now

**3 Sections Update:**

1. **Top (ASCII Art)** - Shows location art (entrance, library, basement, etc.)
2. **Middle (Location Description)** - NOW UPDATES after each command! âœ…
   - Shows current room name
   - Shows description
   - Shows items and exits
3. **Bottom (Message)** - Shows result of your action

## Example Flow

```
You execute: "Go UP"
    â†“
Top: Updates to show Library ASCII art
Middle: Updates to show "Library" description âœ… (THIS WAS BROKEN)
Bottom: Shows "You went up" message
    â†“
Press ENTER to continue
    â†“
Menu shows with new actions for Library
```

## Test It

1. The server auto-reloaded (Flask debug mode)
2. Refresh your browser: http://localhost:5008
3. Try moving between rooms
4. The middle section should now update to show your current location!
