# 💬 ChatGPT-Style NPC Conversations - DONE!

## 🎯 What Changed

NPCs now work like **ChatGPT** - you have a real back-and-forth conversation, not just a single puzzle question!

## ✨ New Experience

### Before (Rigid):
```
1. Click "Talk to NPC"
2. NPC: "Solve my riddle: What is X?"
3. You: Answer puzzle
4. Done ✓
```

### Now (ChatGPT-Style):
```
1. Click "💬 Chat with Little Eliza"
2. Chat box appears
3. You: "Hello"
4. Eliza: "Greetings, brave soul... what brings you here?"
5. You: "I need the candle"
6. Eliza: "Ah, my precious candle... tell me, are you afraid of the dark?"
7. You: "No, I'm brave"
8. Eliza: "I see courage in your eyes... very well, here!"
9. ✨ She gives you the candle!
10. Type "bye" to end chat
```

## 🎮 How It Works

   - Based on your conversation
   - ✨ Automatically gives item!

6. **Type "bye" to exit**
   - Or click "🚪 End Chat"
   - Returns to menu

You: Of course! What game?
Eliza: Tell me... what walks on four legs, then two, then three?

```
