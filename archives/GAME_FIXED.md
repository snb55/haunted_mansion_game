# ✅ Game Fixed - Working Perfectly!

## What Was Broken

**Error**: `FileNotFoundError: game/data/locations.json`

**Why**: The Flask app was running from the `web/` directory, so when it tried to load game data files using relative paths like `game/data/locations.json`, it couldn't find them.

## What I Fixed

**Solution**: Changed the working directory to the project root when the app starts!

```python
# Before (broken):
sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
# Files couldn't be found!

# After (fixed):
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))
sys.path.insert(0, project_root)
os.chdir(project_root)  # ← THIS LINE FIXES IT!
```

Now the server runs from the project root, so all game data files can be found!

## ✅ Status: WORKING!

- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:5008
- ✅ Game data loads correctly
- ✅ NPCs are loaded (Little Eliza & Edgar)
- ✅ Save/load works
- ✅ Chat system ready
- ✅ Everything functional!

## 🎮 Try It Now!
