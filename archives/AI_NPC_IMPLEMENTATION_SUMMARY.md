## 🎮 How It Works

### Game Flow
```
Old Flow:
Enter Room → Take Item → Use Item

New Flow:
Enter Room → See NPC → Talk to NPC → Get Puzzle 
→ Answer Puzzle → Get Item → Take Item → Use Item
```

### AI System
```
Player talks to NPC
    ↓
Game Engine calls AINPC.talk()
    ↓
Build context (personality + game state)
    ↓
Send to Gemini API
    ↓
Get dynamic response
    ↓
Display to player
    ↓
Player answers puzzle
    ↓
AI validates answer
    ↓
If correct: Give item
```

### Context-Aware AI

The AI knows:
- NPC's unique personality
- Player's inventory
- Player's current location
- Conversation history (last 3 exchanges)
- Whether player solved the puzzle
- Game state and progress

This means responses are:
- **Relevant** to the situation
- **In character** at all times
- **Dynamic** - different every time
- **Contextual** - references what's happening

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Remembers context
- ✅ Adapts to game state

### Dynamic Puzzles

- ✅ CLI commands work too

### Fallback System
- ✅ Works without API key (simple responses)

  🚶 Go NORTH

[You select "Talk to Little Eliza"]

Little Eliza says:
"Would you like to play with me? I haven't had a friend in 
so very long... Solve my riddle and I'll give you my special 
candle!

I have cities but no houses, forests but no trees, and water 
but no fish. What am I?"

[Menu shows: 💭 Answer Puzzle]

[You click it, type input box appears]

Your answer: a map

[Submit]

Little Eliza responds:
"CORRECT: Oh you're so clever! Yes, it's a map! You may have 
my candle now, brave adventurer..."

✨ Little Eliza has placed the Candle before you!

[New command appears: 📦 Take Candle]
```

## 🎨 What Makes This Special

### 4. **Atmospheric**
NPCs add personality and depth to the mansion

### 5. **Extensible**
Easy to add more NPCs - just edit the JSON file
